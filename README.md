# Boxing Game

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to use the following types of statements in the js file:

- Apply **if, else if, and else statements** to handle different gameplay scenarios (e.g., basic hit, critical hit, knockout) and exemplify conditional branching.

- Use **conditionals** to determine game outcomes and player health status, troubleshooting issues to create a functional game within the VSCode terminal.

## Game Rules Used to Develop the JS
Players take turns delivering damage to their opponent, with damage randomly ranging between 1 and 10 points. If either player's health drops to 0 or below, they are knocked out, and the game ends.

**Damage categories are:**
1. Basic Hit: Damage less than 6.
2. Critical Hit: Damage between 6 and 9 (inclusive).
3. Knockout: Damage equal to 10.

## Technology Used
- HTML
- Javascript

## Expected Results
**The game follows this sequence:**
1. *Check whose turn* it is to determine who is taking damage.
2. *Set damage* to a random number.
3. *Categorize* the damage based on its value.
4. *Reduce the health* of the player receiving the hit.
5. Check if the player has been *knocked out*.
